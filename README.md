# simple-webpack-boilerplate

The simplest possible webpack boilerplate supporting ES6 (er 2015?) so you can use all those amazing JS packages and npm or yarn.

```
yarn
yarn run serve
```

Oh and it also supports JSX. Okay okay, so it's not actually the simplest possible webpack boilerplate. It imports React, ReactDOM, and says "Hello, World!" with JSX-ey React. But you can easily remove React (and JSX) if you want.
