# simple-webpack-boilerplate

The simplest possible webpack boilerplate so you can use ES6 (er 2015?) and all those amazing JS packages installed with `yarn` (recommended) or `npm`. You can even use React and JSX (actually the default `index.jsx` does just that).

### Howto

Recommended:
```
yarn
yarn run serve
```
or:
```
npm install
npm run serve
```

### One command publish to GitHub Pages

Recommended:
```
yarn run publish-gh-pages
```
or:
```
npm run publish-gh-pages
```

Publishes a build to GitHub pages via a `gh-pages` branch. Okay so this boilerplate is getting less simple, but hey you don't have to use the `publish-gh-pages` command and it creates no additional dependencies.
